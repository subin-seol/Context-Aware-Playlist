## 1. Project Structure

```
app/src/main/java/com/comp90018/contexttunes/
  data/        # Access to sensors, APIs, local storage
  domain/      # Core business logic (rules, models, use cases)
  services/    # Background services (sensor polling, auto mode)
  ui/          # Activities, fragments, UI components
  utils/       # Permission helpers, constants
```

## 4. Development Guidelines

- Use **Android View** in Android Studio for day-to-day coding.
- Use **Project View** for editing config files (e.g., .gitignore, build.gradle).
- Each new feature: create a new Git branch â†’ open a Pull Request â†’ merge to main.
- Keep commit messages short but descriptive (e.g., `feat: add accelerometer service`).

## Features & Requirements

### Sensors Used

- Camera
- GPS
- Light
- Accelerometer

### Functional Requirements

- Detect user activity using accelerometer
- Capture environmental cues: light, GPS, time, weather, camera
- Use context to select/recommend a music playlist
- Integrate with Spotify/Deezer/SoundCloud SDKs
- Notify user when a playlist is ready (push/in-app)
- Run a passive background service for context detection

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Usable, intuitive interface (minimal taps)
- Responsive, non-blocking (threads/services)
- Efficient data collection (battery-friendly)
- Privacy-respecting (camera permission, clear indication)
